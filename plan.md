Guys, whoever looks at that - we're not following TDD yet. So order can be weird and test coverage will be in the end.
We're not publishing task definition here for an obvious reason.


# Questions (probably can figure out later)
- [ ] think where to deploy it to, sometimes technologies/frameworks selection depends on target platform

# MVP
- [ ] Make the stub for the application (something you can run as a web-app)
- [ ] Add basic form on UI
- [ ] Add server-side handler for POST requests. let's say it gets values from requests, decodes it and prints to console like "registering new user firstname=A lastName=B"
- [ ] Add sqlite db, add scheme, figure out insert query to add a user.
- [ ] Add a page to view all registered users. 
- [ ] Add validations on BE/FE would be nice to reuse js class to validate on both
- [ ] Search by name, add indexes, review db
- [ ] Have some fun with bootstrap and angular(maybe?) for 2 pages

# Make it complete
- [ ] Add tests for BE/FE (at least some)
- [ ] Documentation
- [ ] Instruction how to build/run

# MISC
- [ ] Docker
